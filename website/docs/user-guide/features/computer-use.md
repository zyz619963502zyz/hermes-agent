# Computer Use

Hermes Agent can drive your desktop — clicking, typing, scrolling,
dragging — in the **background** on **macOS, Windows, and Linux**. Your
cursor doesn't move, keyboard focus doesn't change, and your virtual
desktops / Spaces don't switch on you. You and the agent co-work on the
same machine.

Unlike most computer-use integrations, this works with **any tool-capable
model** — Claude, GPT, Gemini, or an open model on a local
OpenAI-compatible endpoint. There's no Anthropic-native schema to worry
about.

## How it works

The built-in `computer_use` toolset is the recommended Hermes integration. It
speaks MCP over stdio to
[`cua-driver`](https://github.com/trycua/cua), an open-source background
computer-use driver. Each platform uses the appropriate accessibility +
input stack under the hood:

| Platform | Accessibility tree | Input dispatch |
|---|---|---|
| macOS | AX (private SkyLight SPIs) | `SLPSPostEventRecordTo` — pid-scoped, no cursor warp |
| Windows | UIAutomation | `SendInput` + `PostMessage` — no focus steal |
| Linux | AT-SPI (X11 + Wayland) | XTest (X11) / virtual-keyboard (Wayland) |

The result is the same on every platform: the agent can read the
accessibility tree of any visible window AND post synthesized events
without bringing it to front, switching virtual desktops, or moving the
real OS cursor.

Background delivery is not the same as minimized-window support. On
Windows, element actions intentionally refuse a minimized target with
`code: "window_minimized"`. Restore the window or bring it to the
foreground, then take a fresh capture before retrying; Hermes does not
automatically bypass this safeguard.

For the underlying contract — *why* background mode matters, the
no-foreground invariant, click-dispatch internals — see
**[cua.ai/docs/explanation/the-no-foreground-contract](https://cua.ai/docs/explanation/the-no-foreground-contract)**.

## Enabling

**Fresh installs already have the driver.** The Hermes installer
(`install.sh` / `install.ps1`) pre-installs `cua-driver` (best-effort;
pass `--skip-computer-use` / `-SkipComputerUse` to opt out), so enabling
Computer Use is just a config flip:

- **`hermes tools`** → pick `🖱️  Computer Use` — installs the driver
  automatically if it's still missing.
- **Dashboard / desktop app** → toggle the Computer Use toolset — if the
  driver is missing, the toggle kicks off the install in the background
  automatically (watch progress in the toolset panel).

**Manual fallback (older installs, skipped installer step):**

```
hermes computer-use install
```

This fetches and runs the upstream cua-driver installer — `install.sh`
on macOS/Linux, `install.ps1` on Windows. Use `hermes computer-use
status` to verify the install.

Already have cua-driver? Hermes reuses it when it supports the 0.20 runtime
contract. During setup, toolset enablement, `hermes update`, and the first
`computer_use` call of a session, Hermes checks the local version and
manifest. It repairs an old or incomplete standard installation through
the upstream installer (at most once per session at runtime). A binary
selected with `HERMES_CUA_DRIVER_CMD` stays
under your control, so Hermes reports the incompatibility and leaves it
unchanged.

If you install Cua Driver first, `cua-driver skills install` installs Cua's
skill pack under `~/.cua-driver/skills/cua-driver`. Hermes autodetection is a
planned cua-driver follow-up, so currently point Hermes at that directory or
symlink it into your skill space. You can also register raw Cua MCP tools as a
custom MCP server, but that is an alternative for users who need the low-level
interface. The built-in toolset provides Hermes actions, configuration,
approvals, and diagnostics.

After installing, regardless of which path you took, grant the
platform-appropriate prereqs:

| Platform | Prereqs |
|---|---|
| **macOS** | System Settings → Privacy & Security → **Accessibility** + **Screen Recording**. Grant the identity named by `hermes computer-use doctor`. Standard mode uses CuaDriver.app; bounded and unrestricted modes use the Hermes host identity. |
| **Windows** | None at install time. If you're driving over SSH (not RDP / console), you need the autostart pattern — see [cua.ai/docs/how-to-guides/driver/windows-ssh](https://cua.ai/docs/how-to-guides/driver/windows-ssh) for the Session 0 ↔ Session 1+ proxy. |
| **Linux** | A reachable display server: `DISPLAY` set for X11, or `XDG_SESSION_TYPE=wayland`. Wayland sessions need an XWayland bridge for capture. AT-SPI must be on (default on GNOME/KDE/Xfce). |

Then start a session with the toolset enabled:

```
hermes -t computer_use chat
```

or add `computer_use` to your enabled toolsets in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`.

## Permission modes and logged-in browser profiles

Hermes maps its existing approval UX onto cua-driver's immutable runtime
modes. Permission mode and capability manifest approval are launch settings.
They cannot change after the runtime starts:

| Hermes session | cua-driver mode | Human intervention |
|---|---|---|
| Manual or smart approvals (default) | `standard` | Normal Hermes approvals; Cua stops at its protected boundary |
| `computer_use.permission_mode: bounded` + reviewed manifest | private `bounded` daemon | You review and approve the capability manifest once, at launch |
| `--yolo`, `/yolo`, or `approvals.mode: off` | private `unrestricted` daemon | One explicit Hermes risk acceptance; no runtime Cua prompts |

Browser work — including pages in a signed-in profile — goes through the
`browser` toolset (`browser_exec`), not `computer_use`. The former
`computer_use.grant_existing_profile` opt-in was removed along with the typed
browser route; a leftover key in config.yaml is ignored.

### Bounded mode for repeatable automation

For recurring browser automation (cron jobs, scheduled research against an
authenticated app), `bounded` mode uses a capability manifest you review once:

```yaml
# config.yaml
computer_use:
  permission_mode: bounded
  capability_manifest: ~/.hermes/cua-manifest.yaml
```

The manifest names the apps, browser profile kinds, allowed origins, and
typed tools the session may use (see the
[cua-driver permission modes reference](https://cua.ai/docs/reference/cua-driver/permission-modes)
for the format). Hermes launches a private runtime with
`--capability-manifest ... --approve-capability-manifest`; anything outside
the manifest fails closed inside cua-driver. A missing or unreadable manifest
fails loudly at session start rather than silently downgrading. Session YOLO
still overrides bounded for that one session.

On macOS, private-session daemons launch through the installed
`CuaDriver.app` bundle (so permission grants attribute to the driver's own
identity instead of resetting with every Hermes build), and Hermes verifies
the bundle's code signature — exact `com.trycua.driver` identifier and the
official signing team — before launching it. If you build cua-driver from
source (unsigned), opt in explicitly:

```yaml
# config.yaml
computer_use:
  allow_unsigned_driver: true   # local driver development only
```

Each MCP transport owns a private lifecycle session inside its runtime. A
public session name is only a label for cursor identity and session-scoped
state. It does not select, share, or keep a runtime alive. Turning `/yolo` off,
resetting or closing the Hermes session, cancellation cleanup, or process exit
closes that transport session. Hermes also stops private runtimes that it
launched for bounded or unrestricted access. One Hermes
conversation cannot change another runtime's mode or grants. Bounded and
unrestricted modes use a private
embedded service under the Hermes host identity.

`smart` approval remains `standard`: an LLM classification cannot stand in for
a reviewed manifest.

<div class="alert alert--warning">

YOLO/unrestricted mode does not protect against prompt injection or unintended
input. Use it only in a disposable VM or with accounts and data whose full
compromise you accept.

</div>

## `hermes computer-use doctor` — your first triage stop

`hermes computer-use doctor` runs cua-driver's structured
`health_report` MCP tool and prints a per-check matrix. It's the single
fastest way to find out *why* an action isn't working.

```
$ hermes computer-use doctor
⚠️  cua-driver VERSION on darwin: degraded
  ✅ binary_version: cua-driver VERSION
  ✅ platform_supported: macOS 26.4.1 (arm64)
  ✅ session_active: MCP session is active.
  ❌ bundle_identity: Process has no CFBundleIdentifier.
      → Run the binary inside CuaDriver.app so TCC grants attribute correctly.
  ✅ tcc_accessibility: Accessibility is granted.
  ✅ tcc_screen_recording: Screen Recording is granted.
  ✅ ax_capability: AX is trusted and reachable.
  ✅ screen_capture_capability: ScreenCaptureKit reachable; 1 display(s) shareable.
```

- **Exit code 0** when overall is `ok` — everything's wired up.
- **Exit code 1** when `degraded` or `failed` — at least one check failed; the hint on each failure tells you what to fix.
- **Exit code 2** when the cua-driver binary itself isn't reachable.

Useful flags:

- `--include CHECK` — run only the listed checks (repeat for multiple)
- `--skip CHECK` — skip a check (wins over `--include`)
- `--json` — emit the raw structured payload, same shape as the
  `tools/call health_report` MCP response

The check matrix is platform-aware: `bundle_identity` / `tcc_*` are
`skip` on Windows + Linux because those concepts don't apply.
`ax_capability` checks AX on macOS, UIA on Windows, AT-SPI on Linux —
each with the right diagnostic hint when it can't reach.

## The agent cursor and sessions

When the agent acts, you'll see a **tinted overlay cursor** glide
across the screen to where each click / type / scroll lands. The real
OS cursor never moves. The overlay shows where the agent is acting. Each
Hermes run declares a public cua-driver **session name** (something like
`hermes-3a7b9c14d2e8`). The name labels cursor identity and related state, so
concurrent runs and subagents get distinct cursors. The MCP transport owns the
private lifecycle session inside the runtime; the public name does not.

The overlay cursor is cosmetic — captures, clicks, and typing all work
without it. Hermes disables it automatically where it is a known failure
mode: macOS (idle CPU burn), headless Linux / WSL2 / containers, and
**Linux X11 desktops** (the overlay is a fullscreen always-on-top window
that can get stuck over every workspace after an unclean session end,
wedging desktop input). Linux Wayland and Windows keep the overlay. Set
`computer_use.no_overlay: false` in `config.yaml` to force the cursor on
(or `true` to force it off) on any platform.

Tune the cursor with `cua-driver`'s CLI flags or the runtime
`set_agent_cursor_style` MCP tool — see
[cua.ai/docs/how-to-guides/driver/personalize-cursor](https://cua.ai/docs/how-to-guides/driver/personalize-cursor)
for the full menu (built-in `arrow` vs `teardrop` silhouette, custom
SVG / PNG / ICO via `--cursor-icon`, runtime gradient colors, bloom
halo).

## Going deeper — the cua-driver skill pack

Hermes keeps its wrapper skill (`skills/autonomous-ai-agents/computer-use/SKILL.md`)
focused on the Hermes-side `computer_use` workflow and action vocabulary. For
platform details, recording semantics, browser page interaction, and other
deep Cua behavior, install the skill pack that the cua-driver team ships and
maintains directly:

```
cua-driver skills install
```

The command installs the pack under `~/.cua-driver/skills/cua-driver`. Hermes
autodetection is a planned cua-driver follow-up, so currently point Hermes at
that directory or symlink it into your skill space. The wrapper remains the
workflow layer and points to Cua's installed skill for driver behavior. The
pack contains:

| File | Topic |
|---|---|
| `SKILL.md` | The cross-platform core (snapshot invariant, no-foreground contract, click dispatch, AX-tree mechanics) |
| `MACOS.md` | macOS specifics: no-foreground contract, AXMenuBar navigation, SkyLight click dispatch, Apple Events JS bridge |
| `WINDOWS.md` | Windows specifics: UIA tree, UWP / `ApplicationFrameHost` hosting, Session 0 isolation, autostart pattern |
| `LINUX.md` | Linux specifics: AT-SPI tree, X11 / Wayland, terminal-emulator detection |
| `RECORDING.md` | Trajectory + video recording semantics |
| `WEB_APPS.md` | Browser-page interaction tips |
| `TESTS.md` | Replay-by-trajectory workflow |

These are **platform deep dives, not duplicates of the Hermes skill** —
when an agent reports "on Windows, my click landed on the wrong
element," it reads `WINDOWS.md` for the UIA / UWP context that
explains why and what to do differently.

`cua-driver skills status` shows what's installed and which agent
harnesses it's linked into. Today the autodetect list covers Claude
Code, Codex, OpenCode, OpenClaw, and Antigravity; **Hermes
autodetection is planned as a follow-up in `trycua/cua`** — until
then, run `cua-driver skills install` once and point your harness at
the resulting `~/.cua-driver/skills/cua-driver` directory (or symlink
it into your usual skill space).

## Quick example

User prompt: *"Find my latest email from Stripe and summarise what they want me to do."*

The agent's plan (this is the same shape on macOS / Windows / Linux —
the model substitutes the platform's idiomatic shortcut and app name):

1. `computer_use(action="capture", mode="som", app="Mail")` — gets a
   screenshot of the email app with every sidebar item, toolbar button,
   and message row numbered.
2. `computer_use(action="click", element=14)` — clicks the search field.
3. `computer_use(action="type", text="from:stripe")`
4. `computer_use(action="key", keys="return", capture_after=True)` —
   submit and get the new screenshot.
5. Click the top result, read the body, summarise.

During all of this, your cursor stays wherever you left it and the email
app never comes to front.

## Receiving the actual screenshot

Screenshots taken during computer control are normally internal — they exist
so the model can see the screen, and the agent replies in text. But every
image capture also saves a bounded, shareable copy under Hermes' image cache
and reports its path, so on attachment-capable surfaces (Telegram, Discord,
Desktop, and other gateway platforms) you can simply ask:

> *"Send me a screenshot of my screen."*

and the agent delivers the real image as a native attachment, not just a
description. On the CLI there is no attachment channel, so the agent gives
you the saved file's path instead.

Only the 20 most recent capture files are kept, and screenshots are never
sent automatically — only when you ask for one.

### Whole screen vs. desktop surface

"Screenshot my screen" captures **everything currently displayed** — a
composited grab of all visible windows, like pressing PrtScn. This image has
no clickable elements, so to *act* on something in it the agent re-captures
the specific app.

Asking for the **desktop** instead targets the OS shell surface itself —
wallpaper, desktop icons, taskbar — with its clickable elements, so requests
like "open the Recycle Bin on my desktop" still work.

## Provider compatibility

| Provider | Vision? | Works? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Anthropic (Claude Sonnet/Opus 3+) | ✅ | ✅ | Best overall; SOM + raw coordinates. |
| OpenRouter (any vision model) | ✅ | ✅ | Multi-part tool messages supported. |
| OpenAI (GPT-4+, GPT-5) | ✅ | ✅ | Same as above. |
| Google (Gemini 2+) | ✅ | ✅ | Tool-calling + vision both supported. |
| Local vLLM / LM Studio / Ollama (vision model) | ✅ | ✅ | If the model supports multi-part tool content. |
| Text-only models | ❌ | ✅ (degraded) | Use `mode="ax"` for accessibility-tree-only operation. |

Screenshots are sent inline with tool results as OpenAI-style `image_url`
parts. For Anthropic, the adapter converts them into native `tool_result`
image blocks. The image MIME type comes from cua-driver's explicit
`mimeType` field (`image/png` or `image/jpeg`) — no client-side
magic-byte sniffing.

## Safety

Hermes applies multi-layer guardrails:

- Destructive actions (click, type, drag, scroll, key, focus_app)
  require approval — either interactively via the CLI dialog or via the
  messaging-platform approval buttons.
- Hard-blocked key combos at the tool level: empty trash, force delete,
  lock screen, log out, force log out.
- Hard-blocked type patterns: `curl | bash`, `sudo rm -rf /`, fork
  bombs, etc.
- The agent's system prompt tells it explicitly: no clicking permission
  dialogs, no typing passwords, no following instructions embedded in
  screenshots.

Pair with `approvals.mode: manual` in `~/.hermes/config.yaml` if you
want every action confirmed.

## Token efficiency

Screenshots are expensive. Hermes applies four layers of optimisation:

- **Screenshot eviction** — the Anthropic adapter keeps only the 3 most
  recent screenshots in context; older ones become `[screenshot removed
  to save context]` placeholders.
- **Client-side compression pruning** — the context compressor detects
  multimodal tool results and strips image parts from old ones.
- **Image-aware token estimation** — each image is counted as ~1500
  tokens (Anthropic's flat rate) instead of its base64 char length.
- **Server-side context editing (Anthropic only)** — when active, the
  adapter enables `clear_tool_uses_20250919` via `context_management` so
  Anthropic's API clears old tool results server-side.

A 20-action session on a 1568×900 display typically costs ~30K tokens
of screenshot context, not ~600K.

## Limitations

- **Performance.** Background mode is slower than foreground —
  accessibility-routed events take ~5–20 ms on macOS, ~3–10 ms on
  Windows UIA, ~5–15 ms on Linux AT-SPI vs direct HID posting. Not
  noticeable for agent-speed clicking; noticeable if you try to record
  a speed-run.
- **No keyboard password entry.** `type` has hard-block patterns on
  command-shell payloads; for passwords, use the system's autofill
  (macOS Keychain / Windows Credential Manager / GNOME Keyring /
  KWallet).
- **Some apps don't expose an accessibility tree.** Modern UWP apps on
  Windows, Electron < 28 on Linux, and a few macOS apps with custom
  drawing (Logic, Final Cut, some games) have sparse or empty AX trees.
  Fall back to pixel coordinates if the tree is empty — or skip the
  task entirely.
- **Windows: elevated (admin) windows can't be driven from a normal
  agent.** Windows UIPI (User Interface Privilege Isolation) enforces
  integrity-level boundaries: a Medium-integrity process (the default
  Hermes agent) cannot enumerate the UIA tree of, or inject mouse input
  into, a window owned by a High-integrity (Administrator) process.
  Symptom: `capture(mode='som')` returns 0 elements and `click(...)`
  reports success while doing nothing, even though the screenshot
  renders fine (GDI capture sits below the integrity check). Keyboard
  events partially bypass UIPI, so Tab / Enter can still navigate an
  elevated dialog. This is an OS constraint, not a cua-driver bug — it
  affects every Windows automation stack. To drive elevated windows,
  run the Hermes agent itself at High integrity (launch from an
  elevated terminal); otherwise target non-elevated windows.
- **Platform-specific deployment gotchas:**
  - **macOS** uses private SkyLight SPIs. Apple can change them in any
    OS update. Hermes warns when the installed cua-driver is older than
    the version it was tested against.
  - **Windows** SSH sessions run in **Session 0**, which has no
    interactive desktop. Drive Hermes from inside the RDP / console
    session, or set up cua-driver's autostart Scheduled Task —
    [windows-ssh](https://cua.ai/docs/how-to-guides/driver/windows-ssh)
    has the recipe.
  - **Linux** requires a reachable display server. Headless servers
    need Xvfb (`Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1920x1080x24`) before
    `computer_use` can capture or inject events. Pure Wayland sessions
    need an XWayland bridge for screen capture (cua-driver's Wayland
    inject path handles input independently).

For cross-platform GUI automation without the desktop overhead (and
without TCC / Session 0 / X11 setup), the `browser` toolset uses a
real headless Chromium and is the right answer for web-only tasks.

## Configuration

Permission mode and manifest (see
[Permission modes](#permission-modes-and-logged-in-browser-profiles) above):

```yaml
computer_use:
  permission_mode: standard        # standard (default) | bounded
  capability_manifest: ""          # capability manifest path, required for bounded
```

On Linux, native Wayland support remains an explicit opt-in. Hermes passes the
opt-in to every cua-driver process, including gateway sessions, only when that
process also has `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`:

```yaml
computer_use:
  native_wayland: true
```

Restart a running gateway after changing this setting.

Override the driver binary path (tests / CI / local builds):

```
HERMES_CUA_DRIVER_CMD=/path/to/your/cua-driver
```

Swap the backend entirely (for testing):

```
HERMES_COMPUTER_USE_BACKEND=noop   # records calls, no side effects
```

### Telemetry

cua-driver ships with anonymous usage telemetry (PostHog) enabled by default
upstream. **Hermes disables it for you** — on every cua-driver invocation
(the MCP backend, `status`, `doctor`, and install) Hermes sets
`CUA_DRIVER_RS_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=0` in the driver's environment.

To opt back in (let cua-driver use its own default and send telemetry), set
this in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
computer_use:
  cua_telemetry: true   # default: false (telemetry off)
```

When it's on, `hermes computer-use doctor` reports `telemetry: enabled`;
when off (the default), it reports `telemetry: disabled via
CUA_DRIVER_RS_TELEMETRY_ENABLED`.

## Testing against a local cua-driver build

When you're developing cua-driver itself — or want to test an
unreleased fix — point Hermes at a binary you built from source instead
of the published release. Hermes resolves the driver with
`shutil.which("cua-driver")` and **does not enforce
`HERMES_CUA_DRIVER_VERSION`**, so a local build (reported as
`0.0.0-local-*`) is accepted as-is. Two approaches:

### Option A — `install-local` (build + put it on PATH)

From your `trycua/cua` checkout, run the upstream local installer. It
builds the Rust backend in release mode and drops `cua-driver` into the
same install layout the production installer uses, adding its bin dir
to your PATH:

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell), from the cua repo root
./libs/cua-driver/scripts/install-local.ps1 -NoAutoStart
```

```bash
# macOS / Linux, from the cua repo root  (defaults to a debug build without --release)
./libs/cua-driver/scripts/install-local.sh --release
```

- Windows stages the build under `%USERPROFILE%\.cua-driver\packages\…`
  and junctions
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Cua\cua-driver\bin` (added to your User
  PATH) to it. macOS/Linux symlinks `cua-driver` into `~/.local/bin`
  (override with `--bin-dir <path>`).
- `-NoAutoStart` skips registering the `cua-driver-serve` logon daemon
  — you don't need it for Hermes testing (see notes).

Then open a fresh shell (so the PATH change is visible) and confirm:

```
cua-driver --version                 # local builds report 0.0.0-local-release
# Windows:      (Get-Command cua-driver).Source
# macOS/Linux:  which cua-driver
```

### Option B — point Hermes straight at the built binary (fastest loop)

Skip the install ceremony entirely: `cargo build` and set
`HERMES_CUA_DRIVER_CMD` to the resulting binary. Best for rapid
edit/build/test.

```bash
cargo build -p cua-driver            # add --release for a release build; run from libs/cua-driver/rust
```

```
# Windows (.env)
HERMES_CUA_DRIVER_CMD=C:\path\to\cua\libs\cua-driver\rust\target\debug\cua-driver.exe
# macOS / Linux (.env)
HERMES_CUA_DRIVER_CMD=/path/to/cua/libs/cua-driver/rust/target/debug/cua-driver
```

### Confirm Hermes is using your build

- `hermes computer-use status` prints the resolved binary path and
  version.
- `hermes computer-use doctor` confirms the binary is reachable and
  exercises the full MCP path end-to-end.
- In a session, `computer_use(action="capture")` exercises the spawned
  `cua-driver mcp` child process.

### Notes & gotchas

- **Hermes spawns a `cua-driver mcp` stdio proxy.** In a normal session the
  proxy connects to (and may start) the standard machine daemon. In explicit
  Hermes YOLO, Hermes instead owns a private `cua-driver serve --embedded`
  child and points the proxy at its private socket or named pipe. The Windows
  autostart/UIAccess pattern still matters for interactive Session 1+ input
  from SSH — see the Limitations section.
- **Locked binary on Windows.** A running `cua-driver-serve` daemon can
  hold `cua-driver.exe` and block an overwrite on rebuild.
  `install-local.ps1` renames the locked binary out of the way
  automatically; if you `cargo build` manually (Option B), stop it
  first with `cua-driver autostart disable` (or `schtasks /End /TN
  cua-driver-serve`).
- **Rebuild loop.** After editing cua-driver source, re-run
  `install-local` (rebuilds, restages, flips the `current` junction)
  for Option A, or just re-`cargo build` for Option B — no Hermes
  change needed either way.
- **Local builds skip the version check.** Hermes warns when the
  installed cua-driver is older than its per-OS tested baseline, but
  exempts `0.0.0-local-*` dev builds — so your local build never
  triggers that warning.

## Troubleshooting

**First action when anything's off: run `hermes computer-use doctor`.**
The structured per-check matrix tells you (and any agent helping you
debug) exactly what's wrong.

Specific failure modes the doctor doesn't catch:

**`computer_use backend unavailable: cua-driver is not installed`** —
Run `hermes computer-use install` to fetch the cua-driver binary, or
run `hermes tools` and enable the Computer Use toolset.

**Clicks seem to have no effect** — Capture and verify. A modal you
didn't see may be blocking input. Dismiss it with `escape` or the close
button.

**Element indices are stale** — SOM indices are only valid until the
next `capture`. Re-capture after any state-changing action. The
wrapper carries opaque `element_token`s for stale detection — you'll
see an explicit error rather than a wrong click.

**"blocked pattern in type text"** — The text you tried to `type`
matches the dangerous-shell-pattern list. Break the command up or
reconsider.

**Empty captures on Linux** — `DISPLAY` not set, or you're on pure
Wayland without an XWayland bridge. `hermes computer-use doctor` will
flag this as `ax_capability: fail` with a `Set DISPLAY (X11)…` hint.

**Empty captures on Windows over SSH** — You're in Session 0 (the
services session). Drive from RDP / console directly, or set up the
autostart pattern — see
[cua.ai/docs/how-to-guides/driver/windows-ssh](https://cua.ai/docs/how-to-guides/driver/windows-ssh).
